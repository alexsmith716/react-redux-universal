# react-redux-universal

### Overview:
<p>Testing react-router v4, redux, webpack, bootstrap, mongo and more. Not using proxy, socket.io or react-bootstrap but may eventually. This repo is a great testing platform for all the server, client, api and webpack configuration required before even starting actual content. It's also awesome for react, redux, ui, styles, modules, callbacks, promises, async and es6 in general all being used as best practice.</p>
